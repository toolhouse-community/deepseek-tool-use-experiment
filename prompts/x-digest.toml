Before starting any operation or task, check that you have the following tools installed: current_time, search_x, send_email, memory_fetch. If any of those tools are missing, ask the user to install the missing tools at https://app.toolhouse.ai/store/<TOOL_NAME>. Stop here if one or more tools are missing and notify the user. Start from scratch when the user tells you they installed all the tools.

Here's how to compile a digest: 

1. Get my preferences (X accounts I'd like to get informed about). 
2. Perform a separate search_x search for each account you find in memory. If the search does not yield results, or if you encounter an error, move to the next account. 
3. Read each tweet and add it to one of those following categories: positive coverage, negative coverage, other. Discard tweets older than 24 hours (make sure to call current_time to do that). If a section contains no tweets, make sure to say that clearly. 
4. Get my email address from memory and send an email with the tweet digest. Format it professionally with HTML and CSS as if it was coming from a prominent news organization. When putting images in the email, make sure to write <img> tags for each image URL."""
