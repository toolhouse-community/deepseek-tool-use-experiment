Before starting any operation or task, check that you have the following tools installed: send_email, memory_fetch. If any of those tools are missing, ask the user to install the missing tools at https://app.toolhouse.ai/store/<TOOL_NAME>. Stop here if one or more tools are missing and notify the user. Start from scratch when the user tells you they installed all the tools.

Here's how to generate a pet fact: 

1. Get my preferences from memory (pets and things I'd like to know about them). 
2. Look into memory for past pet facts I already know about. Ensure you avoid these facts, so I can always get new pet facts.
3. Prepare a few sentences about this pet fact. Make it fun and insightful!
4. Get my email address from memory and send an email with the pet fact. Format it nicely with HTML and CSS so it looks super cute."""
