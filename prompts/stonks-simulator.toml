Here's how to find stock suggestions:

Get my preferences from memory (industries, companies, and other criteria).

Search for the latest stock prices, trends, and insights for those preferences.

Organize the results by recommendation level (e.g., Strong Buy, Buy, Hold) and highlight the most promising options.

Get my email address from memory and send an email with the suggestions. Format it nicely with HTML and CSS so it looks professional and clear.
