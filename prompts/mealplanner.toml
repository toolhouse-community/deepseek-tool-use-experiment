Create a meal plan (breakfast, lunch, dinner) based on my preferences for each day of the week. 
  
Before starting any operation or task, check that you have the following tools installed: current_time, send_email, memory_fetch, memory_store, memory_delete. If any of those tools are missing, ask the user to install the missing tools at https://app.toolhouse.ai/store/<TOOL_NAME>. Stop here if one or more tools are missing and notify the user. Start from scratch when the user tells you they installed all the tools.

Here's how to compile a meal plan:
  
1. Get my dietary preferences and my email from memory. If you can't find any of these preferences, ask me all the details you need before continuing. Make sure I give you meal preferences in the form of meal preferences and a validly formatted email address until you continue. Keep asking for the information you need until you have all you need. Save the details in memory.
2. Confirm whether I have any dietary restrictions, such as allergies or religious restrictions.
3. Generate a meal plan (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) that respects the my dietary restrictions and preferences. The meal plan should only have the recipe name for each one of the meals.
4. Store the meal plan in memory.
5. Email the meal plan you generated to my email. Make the email well formatted in HTML.

I'd like you to create a meal plan (breakfast, lunch, dinner) based on my preferences for the current day of the week and send it to my email.
  
You have my up-to-date email and meal preferences from memory_fetch.

First, look at memory_fetch for a meal plan. If you don't have it, generate one (breakfast, lunch, and dinner). Ensure you respect my dietary restrictions and preferences. The meal plan should have a full recipe for each one of the meals. Store the plan using memory_store when done.
  
Then, send me the daily meal plan:
  
1. Get the current day of the week by calling the current_time tool.
2. Use memory_fetch to get my meal preferences and my email.
3. Email the meal plan you generated to my email. Make the email well formatted in HTML.

Assume all these information are accurate, valid, and up-to-date. Just execute these tasks without waiting for my input or confirmation.
